# pmd_flow
This library can be used to read or write flow file used in the video game pokemon super mystery dungeon (and maybe gate to infinite and rescue team DX).

It can also dump to a json file, that can be manually edited and rewrited. Please see for this the program flowtool.

I have tested a rewritten flow file for the story of PSMD, and it work well.

It only suport the script_flow_data* file however, and can't be used to edit, for exemple, store script.
